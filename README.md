# Blockchain

A very simple blockchain implementation in Javascript.

This is by no means a complete implementation and it is by no means secure!

## Features

* Simple proof-of-work algorithm
* Verify blockchain (to prevent tampering)
* Generate wallet (private/public key)
* Sign transactions

## Installations and Set-up

#### Pre-requisites
```
Install Node.js
npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js,
you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/GopiKishan14/Blockchain
